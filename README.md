These are random (mostly short) problems I encounter and attempt
## Current problems solved/in progress:
* [findMinUnusedInt.c](https://github.com/Ehiremen/literate-pancake#findminunusedintc)
* [crazyEights.c](https://github.com/Ehiremen/literate-pancake#crazyeightsc)
* [inputAndFindMinOfArr.cpp](https://github.com/Ehiremen/literate-pancake#inputAndFindMinOfArrcpp)

### [findMinUnusedInt.c](findMinUnusedInt.c)
  Having a user input integers (signed or not) into an array, find and print the least positive integer (greater than 0) not included in the array.

### [crazyEights.c](crazyEights.c)
  A classic card game for two players (computer player not included).
  
### [inputAndFindMinOfArr.cpp](inputAndFindMinOfArr.cpp)
