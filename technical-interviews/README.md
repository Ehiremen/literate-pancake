# **technical-interviews**
#### These are some of the more interesting/peculiar challenges I've encountered during technical interviews.

## Problem Descriptions:

### **[unsortedMedian.cpp](unsortedMedian.cpp):**
        find the median of an unsorted array (iterative access only) without
        changing the array and without using any std/algorithm functions.
        O(1) space constraint, no time constraints.
        Time limit: 30 minutes
