These are random (mostly short) problems I encounter and attempt
## Current problems solved/in progress:
1. [findMinUnusedInt.c](https://github.com/sexylexy22/literate-pancake/blob/edit-readme/README.md#findminunusedintc)

### [findMinUnusedInt.c](findMinUnusedInt.c)
  Having a user input integers (signed or not) into an array, find and print the least positive integer (greater than 0) not included in the array.
